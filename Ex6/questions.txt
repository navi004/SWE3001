1. Consider scenario where two friends x and y are having a joint saving accounts in a bank , name the function for the account as balance.
   The two operations that can be performed on the account is withdraw and deposit a parameter called amount is shared by both x and y by which 
   they will specify the amount to be deposited or withdrawn, assume that at time t0 for the person x's is depositing 1000 to the account and person y 
   is withdrawing Rs.500 from the account at the same time. WAP in C to implement the solution to avoid inconsistency of the amount in the account and also 
   achieve mutual exclusion between them. ("peterson solution")



2. Conside that a group of 4 students are doing a project work and they are storing the information of their individual work in a common file
